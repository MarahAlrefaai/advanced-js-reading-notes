Introduction
In Part 5: UI and React, we saw how to use the React-Redux library to let our React components interact with a Redux store, including calling useSelector to read Redux state, calling useDispatch to give us access to the dispatch function, and wrapping our app in a <Provider> component to give those hooks access to the store.

So far, all the data we've worked with has been directly inside of our React+Redux client application. However, most real applications need to work with data from a server, by making HTTP API calls to fetch and save items.

In this section, we'll update our todo app to fetch the todos from an API, and add new todos by saving them to the API.

Example REST API and Client
To keep the example project isolated but realistic, the initial project setup already included a fake in-memory REST API for our data (configured using the Mirage.js mock API tool). The API uses /fakeApi as the base URL for the endpoints, and supports the typical GET/POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP methods for /fakeApi/todos. It's defined in src/api/server.js.

The project also includes a small HTTP API client object that exposes client.get() and client.post() methods, similar to popular HTTP libraries like axios. It's defined in src/api/client.js.

We'll use the client object to make HTTP calls to our in-memory fake REST API for this section.

Redux Middleware and Side Effects
By itself, a Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions, update the state by calling the root reducer function, and notify the UI that something has changed. Any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store.

Earlier, we said that Redux reducers must never contain "side effects". A "side effect" is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function. Some common kinds of side effects are things like:

Logging a value to the console
Saving a file
Setting an async timer
Making an AJAX HTTP request
Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())
However, any real app will need to do these kinds of things somewhere. So, if we can't put side effects in reducers, where can we put them?

Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects.

As we said in Part 4, a Redux middleware can do anything when it sees a dispatched action: log something, modify the action, delay the action, make an async call, and more. Also, since middleware form a pipeline around the real store.dispatch function, this also means that we could actually pass something that isn't a plain action object to dispatch, as long as a middleware intercepts that value and doesn't let it reach the reducers.

Middleware also have access to dispatch and getState. That means you could write some async logic in a middleware, and still have the ability to interact with the Redux store by dispatching actions.

Using Middleware to Enable Async Logic
Let's look at a couple examples of how middleware can enable us to write some kind of async logic that interacts with the Redux store.

Writing an Async Function Middleware
Both of the middleware in that last section were very specific and only do one thing. It would be nice if we had a way to write any async logic ahead of time, separate from the middleware itself, and still have access to dispatch and getState so that we can interact with the store.

What if we wrote a middleware that let us pass a function to dispatch, instead of an action object? We could have our middleware check to see if the "action" is actually a function instead, and if it's a function, call the function right away. That would let us write async logic in separate functions, outside of the middleware definition.

Redux Async Data Flow
So how do middleware and async logic affect the overall data flow of a Redux app?

Just like with a normal action, we first need to handle a user event in the application, such as a click on a button. Then, we call dispatch(), and pass in something, whether it be a plain action object, a function, or some other value that a middleware can look for.

Once that dispatched value reaches a middleware, it can make an async call, and then dispatch a real action object when the async call completes.
