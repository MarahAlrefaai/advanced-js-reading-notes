AWS: Cloud Servers
Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Japan, and Australia, customers across all industries are taking advantage of the following benefits:

Low Cost
Agility and Instant Elasticity
Open and Flexible
Secure



Cloud Computing
Traditionally, computing took place on physical, local machines and, in the case of online web services, in server rooms consisting of multiple computers. As early as 1961, computer scientist John McCarthy originated the idea that the computer could become the basis of a new and important industry, referring to the sharing of its computational resources [6]. This is considered to be the first step in the history of computation towards cloud computing. The actualization of this underlying concept did not take place until early 2000s
In 2009, Armbrust et al. conducted the ”Berkeley View of Cloud Computing” [7] to explain the rising popularity behind this paradigm. They identified and named six features for the cloud:
• Seemingly infinite computing resources on demand
• Incremental cost, as opposed to paying for physical machines up front
• Allow short-term use of computing resources
Significantly sized data centers allow scaling with reduced costs
• Increased utilization and simpler operation via virtualization of resources
• Maximizing utilization of hardware due to organizations sharing data center resourcesv

AWS EC2
AWS offers a range of EC2 instance types optimized for various purposes. It’s great that they provide so much variety, but of course, it means one more thing that you have to learn. It’s worth taking the time to do so, as ⅔ of IaaS spend (Links to an external site.) goes toward compute – that’s a lot of EC2.
