# Stack
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Stacks follow these concepts:

FILO
First In Last Out
---
# Queue 
Queues follow these concepts:

FIFO
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.


LILO
Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
