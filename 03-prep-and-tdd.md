# sql VS nosql 


#### sql (structured query language)
databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS).

 in sql : 
 1-Data uses schema 
 2-relational (tables related to each other)
 3-Data is distributed across multiple tables 
 4-must to be strict to the schema structure
 5-databases are vertically scalable

 SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

#### nosql 
 databases primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

 nosql : 
 1-document based,key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
 2-databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
 3-are horizontally scalable.
 4-it's not must to be strict to the schema structure.
 5-queries are focused on collection of documents.

 NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Table Name, which is located at the top of the table.
The Primary Keys.  Remember the primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table.  A table typically has one primary key, but can have more.  When the key has more than one column, it is called a compound key.
Table Columns – There can be one or more table columns.  To keep the diagrams simple, I don’t show the data types.  I may introduce those later when we focus on more comprehensive modeling.
Foreign Key – This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.

table relation : 
zero or one-to-many	
one-to-many
zero or one-to-one	
one-to-one

Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1-THE SOFTWARE DESIGN BECOMES MODULAR
2-THE CODE IS EASIER TO MAINTAIN
3-CODE REFACTORING GOES MORE SMOOTHLY

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
 removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and 2. invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.

What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
ES6 Class constructors: ES6 class constructors work quite the same as class constructors in other object-oriented languages. They are used to create new objects.

ES5 function constructor: ES5 function constructors are also used to create objects. The above example can be modified as following through the use of function constructors.

Why REST?
aims to make caching easier
