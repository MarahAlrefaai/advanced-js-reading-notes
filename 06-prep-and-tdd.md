####  JSON Web Token
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

#### JSON Web Token structure
In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

Header
Payload
Signature

#### jsonwebtoken 
Install ==>npm install jsonwebtoken
Usage
jwt.sign(payload, secretOrPrivateKey, [options, callback])
(Asynchronous) If a callback is supplied, the callback is called with the err or the JWT.

(Synchronous) Returns the JsonWebToken as string

payload could be an object literal, buffer or string representing valid JSON.
