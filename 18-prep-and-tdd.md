How does API Gateway work?

API Gateway sits between your API’s backend services and its users, processing HTTP requests to API endpoints and sending them to the appropriate backends. It comes with a suite of tools to assist you in managing your API definitions and mappings between endpoints and backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and provide them as API documentation to your users.

The Amazon API Gateway service is a fully managed service that allows developers to easily construct, publish, maintain, monitor, and protect APIs at any size. APIs allow applications to access data, business logic, and functionality from your backend services through a “front door.” RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs can be created with API Gateway to enable real-time two-way communication applications. Web applications, as well as containerized and serverless workloads, are supported by API Gateway.

API Gateway handles traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management, as well as other responsibilities involved in accepting and processing hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls. There are no minimum fees or initial costs with API Gateway. You pay for the API calls you receive and the data you send out, and you can save money by using the API Gateway’s tiered pricing model as your API usage grows.
